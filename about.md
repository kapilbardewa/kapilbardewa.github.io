# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kapil Bardewa

A lazy fellow trying to get hands dirty on websites and Networks. Always exploring Web, API and Mobile bugs 
to make sure your information are safe and sure. Uncover vulnerabilities and safeguard the digital world.

I will be sharing the content on ethical hacking and the resources to learn and start your cybersecurity carrer.
Will be posting about the HTB machines writeups with all trial and error that was faced
and how I overcame to reach to root.txtðŸ¤ª
